Adds mounts, mastery skills and novelty icons in the form of radial, icon rows and corner icons.

Custom icons, out of combat queueing and automatically loading after map change (mounts only).

[Settings](#settings) need to be configured before using the module!

![](./readme/initial_setup_result.png)

## Settings

1. Enable the module
  ![](./readme/enable_module.png)
1. Go to settings
  ![](./readme/go_to_settings.png)

### General Settings (1st tab)
On the left you'll see a list of actions with their keybinds and icons.

#### Keybinds

The keybinds in the module need to match the ones in you in-game settings:

1. **Match the keybinds to the game settings** and configure the `module keybind` (purple)
  ![](./readme/keybinds.png)
  The game and the module might display different values for the keybinds due to your keyboard layout, especially for QWERTY vs AZERTY etc.
  - Each keybind should have their own unique non-overlapping key. (e.g. not use "B" for 1 keybind and B/Ctrl+B/Alt+B/Shift+B for the other, for more info on overlapping see: blish-hud/Blish-HUD#862)
1. When you are just standing on the ground, not in water, etc you should see this result when you hold down the keybind.
  ![](./readme/initial_setup_result.png)

##### Custom icons
To use custom icons:
- Open the designated folder:
  ![](./readme/custom_icons.png)
- Add your new icons, name them like the existing icons `raptor-something-new.png`. Do not replace files, use new filenames or your icons will be replaced.
- Restart the module by disabling and enabling it (see screenshot step 1)


On the right you'll see a list of settings:

#### The `module keybind`
- The keybind itself
  - Not sent to Gw2.
- `module keybind` behaviour
  - `radial` (see [radial-settings](#radial-settings-2nd-tab))
  - `default` always use the same action.

#### The jump keybind
- Used to detect if the player is gliding in [the IsPlayerGlidingOrFalling radial context](#gliding-and-falling-detection).
  - This must match the in-game keybind as described in [keybinds](#keybinds)
  - Not taken into account when using this key whilst on a mount.

#### Falling or gliding update frequency
- Used to smoothen the input coming from mumble for [the IsPlayerGlidingOrFalling radial context](#gliding-and-falling-detection).
  - Default 0.1.
  - Lower: faster reaction, but might cause flickering depending on framerate etc.
  - Higher: less flickering, but slower change of state (to and from IsPlayerGlidingOrFalling).

#### Display the module on the loading screen
Either display or not display the module on the loading screen.

#### Mount automatically after loading screen
StoreThingForLaterActivation: keeps track of which character is mounted on which mount and re-applies this afterwards. Only applicable on mounts, since for other things we cannot determine if it's in use via the API.


#### Out of Combat queuing
When using an mount that cannot be used in combat we automatically queuing this action when out of combat.

Settings related to out of combat queueing:
  - enable
  - display a spinner when active
  - positioning the spinner on the screen
  - Combat Launch mastery unlocked

The following actions are usable in-game when in combat:
- For both [Skyscale](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_(skill)) and [Skyscale mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_(mastery_skill)) when the  [Combat Launch Mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Combat_Launch) is unlocked.
  - It is not possible to read in-game cooldowns via mumble, so the module does not know when the [Skyscale mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_(mastery_skill)) skill is available.
  - The game launches you in the air for both these skills when you're in combat, see "Mechanics": [Skyscale mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_(mastery_skill)).
  - If you don't want to use this combat launch mastery for skyscale you can disable the "Combat Launch mastery unlocked" setting. 
- Unmount

##### Combat Launch
Currently it's not possible to detect this via the API, see these issues for more information:
  - https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues/31
  - https://github.com/gw2-api/issues/issues/32

The "Combat Launch mastery unlocked" setting was added to mimick this.

#### General Radial Settings
These radial settings are globally applied and should be self explanatory:
- Spawn at mouse (either at mouse position or the center of the screen)
- Radius of the radial
- Start angle of the first thing/action in the list
- Icon size
- Icon opacity
- Action camera keybinding
  - Used to toggle action camera, radial doesn't function well in action camera
  - This must match the in-game keybind as described in [keybinds](#keybinds)

### Radial Settings (2nd tab)
Custom radial settings come in two forms:
- contextual radial settings
- user-defined radial settings

Some settings are common for both contextual- and user-defined radial settings:

#### Enabled
The settings/context is ignored when not enabled.

#### Default action
This action is chosen when
- you selected "Default" as `module keybind` behaviour
- dragging the mouse via right click drag (the mouse being hidden conflicts with action cam detection)

#### Center action
- Center: Which action is displayed in the middle of the radial, either Default (see 1 item higher) or LastUsed.
- Remove center from radial: removes the center action from the radial ring when selected.

#### List of actions
The list of actions that are used in this radial settings/context.

‚ùó If there are actions in the list that do not have a keybind set in the general settings then they will be displayed in red.

#### Contextual Radial Settings
Module versions up until v1.3.3 contained hard coded logic for automatic dismounting, default water mount, default flying mount, default WvW mount, etc.

Later versions got rid of this since the logic became too complex to maintain. Now this logic is configurable by the end user in the form of so-called radials settings (or contexts if you will).

![](./readme/contextual_radial_settings.png)

In above picture we see all states the player character can be in:
- mounted
- in combat
- in WvW map
- gliding, falling (basically flying/in the air)
- under water
- on water surface
- default

These contexts are evaluated according to the evalation order from lowest to highest, first the one with 0, then 1, etc till 99.
This is done because there might be overlap in these states e.g.: a player can both be underwater and mounted.
Only 1 radial/context can be active at the same time.
Being mounted takes precedence in-game so we need to take care of that first.

The last radial setting/context is the default, this one is always active and is used as a fallback.

Which radial settings/context is active is a bit hidden for the end user, but should generally work fine, if you want more information on this enabling [additional debug data will help](#debugging-option-and-logging).

##### Underwater in SotO maps
Normally all water is at the same level (z = 0).
The underwater radial settings/context currently does not support SotO under water areas (some of these are above above z = 0).

##### Gliding and falling detection
Gliding and falling is detected by looking at the z values of the player character and calculating the velocity of that movement.
Gliding only happens downwards and flying can happen both up and downwards (e.g. being catapulted by dismounting, jumping into the air).

Initially there was only 1 threshold for both gliding and falling, but this caused false positives when walking up and down sloped surfaces.

Since version 1.4.2 the threshold for falling has been increased to avoid false positives.
The threshold for gliding has lowered for better detection and an extra input (based on [the jump keybind](#the-jump-keybind)) has been added to avoid triggering when walking on sloped surfaces.

##### Unmounting since 1.4.0
In version 1.3.3 we handled unmounting in the following way:

 - We detect if the player is mounted (this is hard coded).
 - We dismount using the action of the active mount.

In version 1.4.0 we handle unmounting in the following way:

 - We configure which mounts you want to see in the radial when using the IsPlayerMounted radial setting. 
 - If you select multiple things then you will see these in the radial when mounted. 
 - If you select only 1 thing and select "Apply Instantly if single" then we immediately do the single action.
 - The mount/dismount keybind is used to also unmount from chairs, etc.
 - You can dismount using the mount/dismount action.
 - By default from versions 1.4.0 till 1.4.7 the following is migrated: IsPlayerMounted enabled, unmount added. The only thing you need to do is to set the dismount keybind.
 - If you don't want to use the dismount action in the IsPlayerMounted radial settings, please replace it with a mount (e.g.: raptor) and enable [Unconditionally Do Action](#unconditionally-do-action)).
   - By default from versions 1.4.8 onwards the following is migrated: IsPlayerMounted enabled, Raptor added and "Unconditionally Do Action" set to true for IsPlayerMounted. No keybind additions are required. This puts this functionality more in line with how it was in 1.3.3.
 
Per radial settings/context we have the following options:

##### Apply instantly if single
When there is only 1 action configured in a radial context and this option is checked we do not display the radial, but we perform the action immediately instead.
Remember the "hard coded logic" we talked about earlier in the section, this is the replacement of this.

##### Unconditionally Do Action
Used to disable [out of combat queuing](#out-of-combat-queuing), [LastUsed](#center-action) and [mount automatically after loading screen](#mount-automatically-after-loading-screen).
Only useful when the user has configured a mount action (e.g.: Raptor) instead of the dismount action to dismount in the IsPlayerMounted contextual radial settings.

#### User-defined Radial Settings

Users are able to define their own radial settings which are not dependent on the context their character is in.

![](./readme/user_defined_radial_settings.png)

This allows for the creation of seperate sets of things/actions displayed in their own radial.

These keybinds are not sent to Gw2.

These user-defined radial settings each should have their own unique non-overlapping keybind. (e.g. not use "B" for 1 keybind and B/Ctrl+B/Alt+B/Shift+B for the other, for more info on overlapping see: https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD/issues/862)

### Icon Settings (3rd tab)
Icon settings provide rows of actions that are always on the screen.

![](./readme/icon_settings.png)

Up to 5 icon settings can be created.
The default icon settings cannot be removed, they can however be disabled.

Per icon settings we have the following options:
#### Name
Only changeable in icon settings other than the default one.

#### Enabled
Not rendered otherwise.

#### Enable corner icons
Use these actions also for corner icons, only available on the default icon settings.

#### Orientation
Display the row horizontally or vertically.

#### Opacity
The opacity of the displayed icons.

#### Drag
Option to reposition the icons.

#### List of actions
The list of actions that are used in this icon settings.

‚ùó If there are actions in the list that do not have a keybind set in the general settings then they will be displayed in red.


## Debugging option, logging and reporting issues
Before reproducing an issue, please do the following steps:
- make a screenshot of the relevant module settings and in game settings
- turn on "debug logs" and "additional debug data" in BlishHUD (Settings > Overlay settings > "enable debug logging" & "show additional debug data").
  ![](./readme/debug_info.png)
You'll see extra logging and extra debug output on the screen like so:
  ![](./readme/debug_info_result.png)

Then reproduce the issue in as little steps as possible.
- If possible make a video of the reproduction.

Report the issue on [github](https://github.com/bennieboj/BlishHud-Mounts/issues) or post on our [discord](https://discord.gg/jZ37WfsKxR):

## FAQ

### Q: I want to support you
A: I don't expect anything in return, but if you want you can:
- send some gold/items ingame: Bennieboj.2607
- donate via https://ko-fi.com/bennieboj

### Q: Can I configure mouse buttons for keybinds?
A: Not directly, but read on:
- This is a limitation of BlishHUD atm, see [this issue](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD/issues/611) for more information.
- The best way of using mouse buttons is to map the mouse buttons to keyboard keys (e.g.: PageDown) and then use these keyboard keys in-game. The mapping most likely needs to be done in the software of your mouse. This has the added advantage that it works for all use cases since not all mouse buttons are even detected by your OS/GW2 by default (typically mouse 6 and up are not detected).
